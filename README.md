# Plant Life - Ruby App
Plant Life Identifier is a Ruby-based application that leverages the power of image recognition and APIs to identify plants from user-uploaded pictures. This innovative app simplifies the process of discovering plant species by automating the search process and connecting to a comprehensive plant database via API.

Upon receiving an image of a plant, the application utilizes advanced image recognition techniques to analyze the photo's features. It then sends the gathered information to a plant database through an API, which returns relevant details about the identified plant species. Users can quickly and accurately learn about the plants they encounter, all from a single photograph.

With its user-friendly interface and seamless integration with a vast plant database, Plant Life is a valuable tool for nature enthusiasts, gardeners, and researchers alike.
